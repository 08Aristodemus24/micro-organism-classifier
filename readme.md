# **DEVELOPMENT FINISHED, DEPLOYMENT PENDING DUE TO EXCEEDING FILE SIZE OF 300MB**

# This project aims to classify different micro-organisms using their respective microscopic images. Built with React.js, Flask, and Tensorflow

# requirements:
1. git
2. conda
3. python

# Source code usage
1. assuming git is installed clone repository by running `git clone https://github.com/08Aristodemus24/<repo name>`
2. assuming conda is also installed run `conda create -n <environment name e.g. some-environment-name> python=3.11.5`. Note python version should be `3.11.5` for the to be created conda environment to avoid dependency/package incompatibility.
3. run `conda activate <environment name used>` or `activate <environment name used>`.
4. run `conda list -e` to see list of installed packages. If pip is not yet installed run conda install pip, otherwise skip this step and move to step 5.
5. navigate to directory containing the `requirements.txt` file.
5. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the directory containing the `requirements.txt` file
6. after installing packages/dependencies run `python index.py` while in this directory to run app locally

# App usage:
1. control panel of app will have 1 input: The image field which allows the user to upload an image and then upload it to the server for further preprocessing and subsequently fed to the trained model to predict a probability which will further be preprocessed to translate it from probability to prediction
